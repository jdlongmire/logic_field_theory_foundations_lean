  States/Basic.lean - Concrete quantum states for LFT

  This file provides concrete quantum states (|0⟩, |1⟩, |+⟩, |−⟩)
  that are used throughout the formalization for examples and proofs.

# Basic Quantum States

We need concrete states to:
1. Prove no-cloning theorem (needs superposition)
2. Test measurement theorems (needs definite and superposed states)
3. Provide examples for experiments

-- Placeholder for now - we'll define states in next steps
