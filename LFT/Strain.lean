# Logical Strain Functional

This file defines the strain functional D(G) that quantifies logical inconsistency
in admissible graphs. The strain has three components:
- v_I: Identity law violations (always 0 for admissible graphs)
- v_N: Non-decidability/superposition measure
- v_E: Environmental/external constraints
-/

/-- Count vertices in a logical graph -/
noncomputable def vertex_count (G : Omega) : ℕ :=
  sorry -- Would need finite graph assumption or cardinality

/-- Improved v_N: measures non-decidability based on graph structure -/
noncomputable def v_N (G : Omega) : ℝ :=
  if h : vertex_count G = 1 then 0  -- Classical (single vertex) has no strain
  else 1.0  -- Non-classical has positive strain

/-- Identity violations - always 0 for admissible graphs -/
noncomputable def v_I (G : Omega) : ℝ := 0

/-- Environmental constraints - for now, return 0 -/
noncomputable def v_E (G : Omega) : ℝ := 0

/-- The strain functional D(G) -/
noncomputable def StrainFunctional (G : Omega) : ℝ :=
  (1/3) * v_I G + (1/3) * v_N G + (1/3) * v_E G

/-- Classical graphs have zero strain -/
theorem classical_zero_strain : ∃ (G : Omega), StrainFunctional G = 0 := by
  -- We need to construct a single-vertex graph
  sorry -- This requires constructing a specific Omega instance
  -- In a complete implementation, we would:
  -- 1. Define a single-vertex LogicalGraph
  -- 2. Prove it's admissible
  -- 3. Show vertex_count = 1
  -- 4. Conclude StrainFunctional = 0

/-- Alternative approach: Define classical graphs explicitly -/
def IsClassical (G : Omega) : Prop :=
  ∃! v : G.graph.Vertex, ∀ w : G.graph.Vertex, G.graph.Edge v w → w = v

/-- Classical graphs have zero v_N -/
theorem classical_zero_vN (G : Omega) (h : IsClassical G) : v_N G = 0 := by
  sorry

/-- Therefore classical graphs have minimal strain -/
theorem classical_minimal_strain (G : Omega) (h : IsClassical G) :
    StrainFunctional G = 0 := by
  unfold StrainFunctional
  rw [v_I, v_E]
  simp
  rw [classical_zero_vN G h]
  simp

/-- Superposition (multi-vertex) graphs have positive strain -/
theorem superposition_positive_strain :
    ∀ (G : Omega), ¬IsClassical G → StrainFunctional G > 0 := by
  intro G h_not_classical
  unfold StrainFunctional
  rw [v_I, v_E]
  simp
  -- Since G is not classical, v_N G = 1.0
  sorry -- Need to prove v_N G = 1.0 when not classical

/-- Strain is always non-negative -/
theorem strain_nonneg : ∀ (G : Omega), 0 ≤ StrainFunctional G := by
  intro G
  unfold StrainFunctional
  unfold v_I v_E
  simp
  -- v_N is either 0 or 1, both non-negative
  sorry
