# logic_field_theory_foundations_lean
Formal verification of Logic Field Theory (LFT) in Lean 4. We derive QM from the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle), showing QM emerges from logical necessity not physical postulates. Includes proofs of complex amplitude necessity, Born rule emergence, and measurement from strain thresholds.
