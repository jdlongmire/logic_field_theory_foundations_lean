## Overview

This repository contains the **machine-verifiable formalization** of *Logic Field Theory (LFT)* in **Lean 4**, based on the v3.0 paper:

> **Logic Field Theory: Deriving Quantum Mechanics from the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic**  
> James D. Longmire  
> Northrop Grumman Fellow (unaffiliated research)

LFT is a **logic-first derivation** of quantum mechanics. It shows that the mathematical structure of QM‚Äîcomplex Hilbert spaces, unitary evolution, and the Born rule‚Äîemerges **necessarily** from the requirement that reality remain logically consistent under superposition, given the **Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL)**:

1. **Identity**: $A = A$
2. **Non-Contradiction**: $\neg (A \land \neg A)$
3. **Excluded Middle**: $A \lor \neg A$

Unlike interpretations of QM that assume the formalism, LFT derives it from **graph-theoretic logical structures** and a **strain functional** $D(G)$ defined via maximum entropy principles.

## Project Goals

* **Primary:** Fully mechanize the LFT derivation in Lean 4, from logical axioms to testable quantum predictions.
* **Secondary:** Provide a modular library for formal reasoning about pre-quantum logical structures.
* **Tertiary:** Support experimental and theoretical research by producing machine-verified lemmas and theorems from the LFT framework.

## Repository Structure

```
LFT/
  Basic.lean       # Three Fundamental Laws of Logic as axioms
  Graphs.lean      # Directed graph structures, entailment relations, admissibility
  Strain.lean      # Logical strain functional scaffold (vI, vN, vE)
  Dynamics.lean    # Hilbert space emergence, unitary evolution, Schr√∂dinger derivation
  Tests.lean       # Unit tests for definitions and proofs
```

* **`LFT/Basic.lean`**  
  Encodes the 3FLL in Lean as foundational axioms.

* **`LFT/Graphs.lean`**  
  Defines **logical graphs**: vertices as propositions, directed edges as entailment. Includes admissibility checks for 3FLL compliance and graph operations (tensor product, superposition).

* **`LFT/Strain.lean`**  
  Implements the **strain functional**:

  $$D(G) = w_I v_I(G) + w_N v_N(G) + w_E v_E(G)$$

  with placeholders for:
  * `vI` ‚Äì **Identity violations** (path-proximity metric, Eq. (8) in paper)
  * `vN` ‚Äì **Non-decidability** (entropy measure, Eq. (9))
  * `vE` ‚Äì **Environmental misfit** (boundary mismatch, Eq. (10))

* **`LFT/Dynamics.lean`**  
  Will implement:
  * Hilbert space emergence (Section 5)
  * Logical Lagrangian and Schr√∂dinger equation (Section 6.2‚Äì6.3)
  * Born rule derivation (Sections 6.6 & 7.5)

## Current Status

### **Branch**
`main`

### **Build**
‚úÖ Clean compile:
```bash
lake build
lake build LFT.Strain
```

### **Checkpoint Tag**
`lft-lean4-checkpoint` ‚Äì safe rollback point.

### **Implemented**
* Graph scaffold (`Graphs.lean`)
* Strain functional skeleton with weighted components (`Strain.lean`)
* 3FLL axioms (`Basic.lean`)
* Minimal tests and lemmas

### **Placeholders Remaining**
* Full path-proximity metric for `vI`
* Entropy-based calculation for `vN`
* Observational mismatch metric for `vE`
* Proofs of convexity, metric properties, and compositional additivity

## Roadmap

### **Phase 1 ‚Äì Core Definitions**
1. Implement `vI`, `vN`, and `vE` per v3.0 paper definitions (Section 4.3).
2. Prove `D(G) = 0` iff $G$ is classically consistent.
3. Define admissible graph space $\Omega$.

### **Phase 2 ‚Äì Hilbert Space Embedding**
4. Formalize graph superposition (Section 3.5.1).
5. Prove complex necessity from Excluded Middle (Section 5.3).
6. Derive Hermitian inner product from logical distinguishability.

### **Phase 3 ‚Äì Dynamics**
7. Implement Logical Lagrangian (Eq. (30)).
8. Derive Schr√∂dinger equation (Eq. (31)).
9. Prove unitarity and energy-strain correspondence.

### **Phase 4 ‚Äì Measurement & Predictions**
10. Implement measurement threshold criterion (Eq. (44)).
11. Formalize Born rule derivation with strain corrections (Eq. (55)).
12. Encode testable predictions for simulation.
