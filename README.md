# Logic Field Theory â€“ Lean 4 Formalization

## Overview

This repository contains the **machine-verifiable formalization** of *Logic Field Theory (LFT)* in **Lean 4**, based on the v3.0 paper:

LFT is a **logic-first derivation** of quantum mechanics. It shows that the mathematical structure of QMâ€”complex Hilbert spaces, unitary evolution, and the Born ruleâ€”emerges **necessarily** from the requirement that reality remain logically consistent under superposition, given the **Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL)**:

1. **Identity**: $A = A$
2. **Non-Contradiction**: $\neg (A \land \neg A)$
3. **Excluded Middle**: $A \lor \neg A$

Unlike interpretations of QM that assume the formalism, LFT derives it from **graph-theoretic logical structures** and a **strain functional** $D(G)$ defined via maximum entropy principles.

## Project Goals

* **Primary:** Fully mechanize the LFT derivation in Lean 4, from logical axioms to testable quantum predictions.
* **Secondary:** Provide a modular library for formal reasoning about pre-quantum logical structures.
* **Tertiary:** Support experimental and theoretical research by producing machine-verified lemmas and theorems from the LFT framework.

## Repository Structure

```
LFT/
  Basic.lean       # Three Fundamental Laws of Logic as axioms
  Graphs.lean      # Directed graph structures, entailment relations, admissibility
  Strain.lean      # Logical strain functional scaffold (vI, vN, vE)
  Dynamics.lean    # Hilbert space emergence, unitary evolution, SchrÃ¶dinger derivation
  Tests.lean       # Unit tests for definitions and proofs
```

* **`LFT/Basic.lean`**
  Encodes the 3FLL in Lean as foundational axioms.

* **`LFT/Graphs.lean`**
  Defines **logical graphs**: vertices as propositions, directed edges as entailment. Includes admissibility checks for 3FLL compliance and graph operations (tensor product, superposition).

* **`LFT/Strain.lean`**
  Implements the **strain functional**:

  $$
  D(G) = w_I v_I(G) + w_N v_N(G) + w_E v_E(G)
  $$

  with placeholders for:

  * `vI` â€“ **Identity violations** (path-proximity metric, Eq. (8) in paper)
  * `vN` â€“ **Non-decidability** (entropy measure, Eq. (9))
  * `vE` â€“ **Environmental misfit** (boundary mismatch, Eq. (10))

* **`LFT/Dynamics.lean`**
  Will implement:

  * Hilbert space emergence (Section 5)
  * Logical Lagrangian and SchrÃ¶dinger equation (Section 6.2â€“6.3)
  * Born rule derivation (Sections 6.6 & 7.5)

## Roadmap

### **Phase 1 â€“ Core Definitions**

1. Implement `vI`, `vN`, and `vE` per v3.0 paper definitions (Section 4.3).
2. Prove `D(G) = 0` iff $G$ is classically consistent.
3. Define admissible graph space $\Omega$.

### **Phase 2 â€“ Hilbert Space Embedding**

4. Formalize graph superposition (Section 3.5.1).
5. Prove complex necessity from Excluded Middle (Section 5.3).
6. Derive Hermitian inner product from logical distinguishability.

### **Phase 3 â€“ Dynamics**

7. Implement Logical Lagrangian (Eq. (30)).
8. Derive SchrÃ¶dinger equation (Eq. (31)).
9. Prove unitarity and energy-strain correspondence.

### **Phase 4 â€“ Measurement & Predictions**

10. Implement measurement threshold criterion (Eq. (44)).
11. Formalize Born rule derivation with strain corrections (Eq. (55)).
12. Encode testable predictions for simulation.
