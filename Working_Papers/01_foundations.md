# Logic Field Theory v5 — Foundations

**Status:** draft-ready for repo  
**Purpose:** formal core, notation, and axioms prior to embeddings and dynamics

---

## 0. Scope

This file establishes the formal backbone of Logic Field Theory (LFT). It fixes the **core identity**, the **object types**, and the **operator laws** that all later sections reference. It also separates **Tier 1** logical facts from **Tier 2** representation principles so reviewers can see exactly where modeling enters.

---

## 1. Core identity

| $\mathcal{A} = \mathbb{L}(\mathcal{S})$ |
|---|





- **$\mathcal{S}$**  Information-state universe. Concrete model: finite directed labeled graphs with a designated negation map $v\mapsto \lnot v$.  
- **$\mathbb{L}$**  Logic-enforcement operator that applies the **Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL)** to elements of $\mathcal{S}$.  
- **$\mathcal{A}$**  Set of admissible configurations, the fixed points of $\mathbb{L}$.

**Operator laws** on the powerset lattice $(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S}),\subseteq)$:

1. **Monotone**: $X\subseteq Y \Rightarrow \mathbb{L}(X)\subseteq \mathbb{L}(Y)$  
2. **Idempotent**: $\mathbb{L}(\mathbb{L}(X))=\mathbb{L}(X)$  
3. **Contractive**: $\mathbb{L}(X)\subseteq X$

Equivalently, $\mathcal{A} = \{ s\in\mathcal{S} : s=\mathbb{L}(s)\}$ and $\mathrm{Fix}(\mathbb{L})=\mathcal{A}$.

## 2. Concrete graph instantiation of $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{A}$

Let a state be a finite directed labeled graph $G=(V,E,\lnot)$ with a vertex-level involution $\lnot:V\to V$ where $\lnot(\lnot v)=v$.

**3FLL admissibility:**

1. **Identity**: $\forall v\in V$, $(v,v)\in E$.  
2. **Non-Contradiction**: There is **no** path $v\to\cdots\to \lnot v$ in $E^{*}$.  
3. **Excluded Middle**: For each proposition symbol $p$, exactly one of $\{p,\lnot p\}$ appears in any consistent subgraph.

Then

$$

\mathcal{A}  =  \{ G\in\mathcal{S} : G \text{ satisfies 1–3} \},\quad
\mathbb{L}(X)  =  X\cap\mathcal{A}.

$$

**Lemma 2.1 (closure under intersection).** The set of admissible graphs is closed under intersection of edge and vertex sets.  
*Proof sketch.* Removing vertices or edges cannot introduce a contradiction path or add dual presence; identity loops that remain are preserved. ■

**Remark.** This concrete model is a working instantiation; the proofs and constructions below depend only on the abstract properties of $\mathbb{L}$ and the existence of $\mathcal{A}$, not on a specific syntax.

## 3. Equivalence classes and separability

Define logical equivalence $G\sim H$ if they induce the same classical consequences given the edge types and negation map. Let $[G]$ denote the equivalence class in $\tilde{\Omega}=\mathcal{A}/\sim$.

**A1 (Separability).** $\tilde{\Omega}$ is countable.  
Pragmatic justification: we work with finitely generated graphs over a countable symbol set. This is a representation axiom, not a theorem of 3FLL.

## 4. Tier separation

We keep two tiers explicit:

- **Tier 1 (T1):** pure 3FLL content (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle) and their immediate consequences for admissibility.  
- **Tier 2 (T2):** representation and composition principles needed to model, transform, and compose admissible content.

**T2 axioms used later**

- **A2 Distinguishability kernel:** distinct logical contents are orthogonal, identical content has unit norm in the free vector space over $\tilde{\Omega}$.  
- **A3 Symmetry action:** admissibility-preserving automorphisms act by strongly continuous overlap-preserving maps.  
- **A4 Coherence invariance in time:** there exists a strongly continuous 1-parameter family preserving transition magnitudes.  
- **A5 Logical probability valuation:** normalized, finitely additive on orthogonal families, noncontextual, unitary-invariant.  
- **A7 Order-independent composition:** scalar field commutes across independent subsystems.  
- **C1 Orientation sensitivity:** clockwise vs counterclockwise inference cycles are distinct.  
- **C2 Connected change:** admissibility-preserving deformations act via strongly continuous subgroups.

These are not claimed to follow from 3FLL. They articulate how we represent and compose logical content.

## 5. Roadmap to later files

- **03\_vector\_space\_embedding.md** builds the free vector space over $\tilde{\Omega}$, justifies the diagonal inner product, and proves that the scalar field must be $\mathbb{C}$ from C1, C2, A3, A7.  
- **04\_quantum\_structure.md** derives unitary dynamics from A4 and obtains the Born rule from A5 (Gleason/Busch).  
- **05\_dynamics.md** develops the generator and action principles consistent with coherence preservation.  
- **02\_strain\_theory.md** introduces the strain functional and the resolution-timing policy that leaves Born weights untouched.

## 6. Notation policy

- Reserve $\mathcal{A}, \mathbb{L}, \mathcal{S}$ for the core identity.  
- Do not reuse $\Omega$ for probability spaces.  
- Name probability triples as $(X,\Sigma,\mathsf{P})$ if needed later.

## 7. Version note

This document synthesizes v3.0, v3.2, v4.0, and the new v5 derivations. The separation into T1 and T2 is deliberate for peer review and Lean formalization.
